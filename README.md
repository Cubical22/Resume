## The resume project
this is my first GitHub repository, made rather late into production sadly ;(
I uploaded the following project so that anyone can access the sample projects I uploaded locally.

## Getting started:
you can get started with the project really quickly:
  1. run `npm install` on the server dir
  2. run `npm run devStart` and then, open a browser on local host 3000

## Routing done:
since this project is made using different frameworks, the routing done on files
is a mess. There are several different routes the user can access:
  1. assets: which can be accessed as simple as `/assets/:id`
  2. images: which can be accessed as simple as `/src/images/:id`
     this dir also has `/src/images/sample-project-thumbnails/:id`
     all images here have a format of `*.png`.
  3. libraries: this is used to access the libraries I used locally to build this project.
     these files can be accessed using `/libraries/:id`.
  4. saves: this one is used to save different information on the server,
     such as requests and text-share-saves. some require admin access, some don't.
  5. src: this one is used for the projects done on either vueJs or React.
     can be accessed like this: `/src/{sub-dir}/:id`.
     there are 4 current sub-dirs, including assets, css, js, and svg.
>That marks all of them, if I missed any, I apologize :) 
     

## Note:
the project is also uploaded on the web
here is the full address:
