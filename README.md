## The resume project
this is my first GitHub repository, made rather late into production sadly ;(
I uploaded the following project so that anyone can access the sample projects I uploaded locally.

## Getting started:
you can get started with the project really quickly:
  1. run `npm install` on the server dir
  2. run `npm run devStart` and then, open a browser on local host 3000

## Note:
the project is also uploaded on the web
here is the full address:
